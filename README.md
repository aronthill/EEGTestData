**Example EEG recordings for testing RELAX-Jr**

These are four example resting-state EEG recordings that may be used as test data files for the RELAX-Jr pre-processing software. P Files are in EEGLAB (.set) format and are 3 minutes in length with a sampling rate of 500 Hz. EEG was recorded using a Geodesic SensorNet while childrem watched videos. 

These files were taken from a larger open-access (CCO license) dataset on the OpenNeuro repository recorded by a seperate lab to our own ( for full details see: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004635/versions/3.0.0). These files provided here purely for the purpose of testing the RELAX-Jr software. 

To reduce file size, the files have been reduced in length (first 3 minutes of the recording), downsampled from 1 KHz to 500 Hz, and reduced from a 128 to 64 channel montage. No other pre-processing has been applied.
